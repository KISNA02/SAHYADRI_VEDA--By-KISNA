      <p>Lingana Fort is a rugged pinnacle situated between the famous Raigad and Torna forts. It was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the 17th century as a strategic watchtower and prison. This trek is one of the most technically challenging climbs in Maharashtra, requiring ropes and climbing gear.</p>
      <p>There are no steps or structured trails, and the route involves steep rock patches and vertical climbs. Itâ€™s not suitable for casual trekkers or solo attempts and is often done with certified guides and climbing groups. Despite the difficulty, the panoramic views and adrenaline rush make it one of the most thrilling climbs in the Sahyadri range.</p>

  <h1>Tikona Fort Trek</h1>

  <p><strong>Location/Region:</strong> Near Pawna Lake</p>
  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>
  <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> 3,600 feet (1,100 meters)</p>
  
  <p>Tikona Fort, also known as Vitandgad, gets its name from its triangular shape (“Tikona” in Marathi means triangle). It is one of the most picturesque treks near Pawna Lake and is popular for its short, steep, and exciting climb. The fort was an important part of the Maratha kingdom and was captured by Shivaji Maharaj in the 17th century.</p>

  <p>The trek starts from Tikona Peth village, and the initial route passes through green fields and muddy trails during monsoon. After about 20–30 minutes of gradual ascent, the climb becomes slightly steeper with narrow rock-cut steps and railings for support. Though short in distance, the final ascent requires care, especially during rains.</p>

      <p>Kamalgad Fort, also known as Bhelanja or Kattalgad, is an isolated fort located near Wai in Satara district. It stands out for its massive vertical cliff drop and the absence of typical fort structures like gates or temples.</p>
      <p>The fort is surrounded by thick forests and is reachable via a trail that begins at Tupewadi village. A guide is recommended as the final stretch requires careful navigation. At the top, you’ll find a square-shaped rock cut into the hill with a mysterious deep hole called the “Katal.” The fort’s eerie silence and raw wilderness make it a captivating destination for serious trekkers.</p>

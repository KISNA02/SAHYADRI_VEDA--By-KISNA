  <h1>Korigad Fort Trek</h1>

  <p><strong>Location/Region:</strong> Aamby Valley, Lonavala</p>
  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>
  <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> 3,050 feet (930 meters)</p>
  
  <p>Korigad Fort is a peaceful and easily accessible hill fort located close to Lonavala and Aamby Valley. It is ideal for beginners, families, and casual trekkers due to its short climb and well-defined trail. The fort gets its name from the Goddess Korai Devi, whose temple still stands at the summit. It was incorporated into the Maratha Empire by Shivaji Maharaj in the 17th century.</p>

  <p>The trek starts from Peth Shahpur village, and the path is fairly straightforward, with a mixture of forest trail and stone steps. Even during monsoon, the climb remains manageable, though care should be taken on slippery patches. The trail leads to a massive entrance gate and stone fortifications, offering a glimpse into Maratha-era defense structures.</p>
